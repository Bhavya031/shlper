# Interactive YouTube Video Project

## Overview

This is my college project, developed over a period of two weeks for a mini-project assignment. The project was built during class sessions.

## Goal

The objective of this project is to create a website that allows users to interact with YouTube videos using a local machine.

## Achievements

- Developed a working website that interacts with YouTube videos using local language models (LLMs) and a local machine.
- Despite the slow response times, the interaction functionality is operational.

## Note

- APIs are currently not functional. I will update the APIs and documentation as soon as I have the time.

## Working Video
Here is a video demonstrating the project's functionality:
