Afghanistan.\\\\n\\\\n10\\\\n00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,000\\\\nHe\\'s also a highly accomplished ultramarathon runner.\\\\n\\\\n11\\\\n00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,360\\\\nFor those of you that don\\'t know,\\\\n\\\\n12\\\\n00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,720\\\\nultramarathons are distances longer than 26 miles, and in David\\'s case, often longer\\\\n\\\\n13\\\\n00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,840\\\\nthan 200 miles. For his achievements in athletics, he has been inducted into the International\\\\n\\\\n14\\\\n00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,260\\\\nSports Hall of Fame. He also held a Guinness World Record for the most pull-ups completed\\\\n\\\\n15\\\\n00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,400\\\\nin 24 hours. I should mention that not only was David a decorated Navy SEAL, but he also\\\\n\\\\n16\\\\n00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,840\\\\ngraduated from Army Ranger School. David is also a highly successful writer, having authored\\\\n\\\\n17\\\\n00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,040\\\\ntwo books, the first entitled Can\\'t Hurt Me and the second entitled Never Finished, both of which\\\\n\\\\n18\\\\n00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,640\\\\nare bestsellers. David\\'s books cover many topics including his autobiographical description\\\\n\\\\n19\\\\n00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,280\\\\nof what can only be described as an incredibly challenging child and young adulthood. His home\\\\n\\\\n20\\\\n00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,880\\\\nwas abusive, his school environment was abusive, he essentially had no positive resources directed\\\\n\\\\n21\\\\n00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,880\\\\nhis way. And in his 20s he found himself to be obese, that is more than 300 pounds working a\\\\n\\\\n22\\\\n00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,080\\\\njob he despised for minimal pay. And it was at that point that David began an inner dialogue\\\\n\\\\n23\\\\n00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,280\\\\nthat forced him to explore the demons born out of his childhood, but also the position that he\\\\n\\\\n24\\\\n00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,360\\\\nfound himself in as a young man, and then began the journey to navigate that dialogue and transform\\\\n\\\\n25\\\\n00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,840\\\\nhimself into the Navy SEAL, the ultramarathon runner, the best-selling author, and the\\\\n\\\\n26\\\\n00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,840\\\\nextraordinarily positive and influential man that he is today. As some of you may know, David has\\\\n\\\\n27\\\\n00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,480\\\\nhas done various public lectures.\\\\n\\\\n28\\\\n00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,680\\\\nHe\\'s a familiar face online\\\\n\\\\n29\\\\n00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,640\\\\nbecause there are so many clips of him on YouTube\\\\n\\\\n30\\\\n00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,420\\\\nand he has done podcasts before.\\\\n\\\\n31\\\\n00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,760\\\\nHowever, I\\'m certain that you\\'ll find today\\'s discussion\\\\n\\\\n32\\\\n00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,520\\\\nto be very different than previous podcasts\\\\n\\\\n33\\\\n00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,640\\\\nthat David has been featured on.\\\\n\\\\n34\\\\n00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,760\\\\nThe reason is that,\\\\n\\\\n35\\\\n00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,500\\\\nof course we get into his accomplishments.\\\\n\\\\n36\\\\n00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,260\\\\nWe talk about the mindset\\\\n\\\\n37\\\\n00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,400\\\\nthat allowed him to achieve those things.\\\\n\\\\n38\\\\n00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,840\\\\nBut today, David really lets us under the hood.\\\\n\\\\n39\\\\n00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,200\\\\nHe lets us into the form of inner dialogue\\\\n\\\\n40\\\\n00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,800\\\\nthat he has to embrace,\\\\n\\\\n41\\\\n00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,360\\\\nindeed that he has to grapple with on a daily basis,\\\\n\\\\n42\\\\n00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,480\\\\nsometimes multiple times throughout the day and night\\\\n\\\\n43\\\\n00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,580\\\\nin order to impose the sort of

mechanisms\\\\n\\\\n46\\\\n00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,040\\\\nunderlying willpower,\\\\n\\\\n47\\\\n00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,420\\\\nand we talk about David\\'s current endeavors\\\\n\\\\n48\\\\n00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,400\\\\nthat include, for instance,\\\\n\\\\n49\\\\n00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,720\\\\nhis own exploration of science and medicine\\\\n\\\\n50\\\\n00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,560\\\\nfor which he has become an intense scholar and practitioner.\\\\n\\\\n51\\\\n00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,840\\\\nI should mention that multiple times\\\\n\\\\n52\\\\n00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,660\\\\nthroughout today\\'s discussion, you will hear curse words.\\\\n\\\\n53\\\\n00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,960\\\\nNow, David and I both

different\\\\n\\\\n56\\\\n00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,760\\\\nthan cursing at somebody.\\\\n\\\\n57\\\\n00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,320\\\\nNonetheless, we do realize that many people,\\\\n\\\\n58\\\\n00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,380\\\\nparents perhaps especially, might not want to hear cursing.\\\\n\\\\n59\\\\n00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,140\\\\nIf you don\\'t want to hear cursing,\\\\n\\\\n60\\\\n00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,620\\\\nwell then this podcast episode is probably not for you.\\\\n\\\\n61\\\\n00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,960\\\\nHowever, if you are comfortable with cursing\\\\n\\\\n62\\\\n00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,500\\\\nor if you can tolerate it,\\\\n\\\\n63\\\\n00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,660\\\\nI assure you today\\'s discussion is highly worthwhile.\\\\n\\\\n64\\\\n00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,420\\\\nBefore we begin, I\\'d like to emphasize that this podcast\\\\n\\\\n65\\\\n00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,220\\\\nis separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\\\n\\\\n66\\\\n00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,540\\\\nIt is, however, part of my desire and effort\\\\n\\\\n67\\\\n00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,380\\\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\\\\n\\\\n68\\\\n00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,500\\\\nabout science and science-related tools\\\\n\\\\n69\\\\n00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,900\\\\nto the general public.\\\\n\\\\n70\\\\n00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,020\\\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\\\n\\\\n71\\\\n00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,000\\\\nI\\'d like to thank the sponsors of today\\'s podcast.\\\\n\\\\n72\\\\n00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,820\\\\nOur first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.\\\\n\\\\n73\\\\n00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,260\\\\nMaui Nui Venison is the most nutrient dense\\\\n\\\\n74\\\\n00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,260\\\\nand delicious red meat available.\\\\n\\\\n75\\\\n00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,060\\\\nI\\'ve spoken before on this podcast\\\\n\\\\n76\\\\n00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,660\\\\nand there\\'s general consensus\\\\n\\\\n77\\\\n00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,580\\\\nthat most people should strive to consume\\\\n\\\\n78\\\\n00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,860\\\\napproximately one gram of protein per pound of body weight.\\\\n\\\\n79\\\\n00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,640\\\\nNow, when one strives to do that,\\\\n\\\\n80\\\\n00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,620\\\\nit\\'s important to maximize the quality\\\\n\\\\n81\\\\n00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,260\\\\nof that protein intake to the calorie ratio\\\\n\\\\n82\\\\n00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,880\\\\nbecause you don\\'t want to consume an excess of calories\\\\n\\\\n83\\\\n00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,900\\\\nwhen trying to get that one gram of protein\\\\n\\\\n84\\\\n00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,380\\\\nper pound of body weight.\\\\n\\\\n85\\\\n00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,060\\\\nMaui Nui venison has an extremely high quality protein\\\\n\\\\n86\\\\n00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,020\\\\nto calorie ratio,\\\\n\\\\n87\\\\n00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,980\\\\nSo it makes getting that one gram of protein\\\\n\\\\n88\\\\n00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,100\\\\nper pound of body weight extremely easy.\\\\n\\\\n89\\\\n00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,340\\\\nIt\\'s also delicious.\\\\n\\\\n90\\\\n00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,860\\\\nPersonally, I like the ground venison.\\\\n\\\\n91\\\\n00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,420\\\\nI also like the venison steaks.\\\\n\\\\n92\\\\n00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,020\\\\nAnd then for convenience, when I\\'m on the road,\\\\n\\\\n93\\\\n00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,080\\\\nI like the jerky.\\\\n\\\\n94\\\\n00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,160\\\\nThe jerky is a very high protein to calorie ratio.\\\\n\\\\n95\\\\n00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,380\\\\nSo it has as much as 10 grams of protein per jerky stick,\\\\n\\\\n96\\\\n00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,740\\\\nand it has something like only like 55 calories.\\\\n\\\\n97\\\\n00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,140\\\\nSo again, making it very easy to get enough protein\\\\n\\\\n98\\\\n00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,020\\\\nwithout consuming excess calories.\\\\n\\\\n99\\\\n00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,220\\\\nIf you would like to try Maui Nui venison,\\\\n\\\\n100\\\\n00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,680\\\\nyou can go to mauinuivenison.com slash

AeroPress.\\\\n\\\\n105\\\\n00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,500\\\\nAeroPress is similar to a French press for making coffee,\\\\n\\\\n106\\\\n00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,580\\\\nbut is in fact a much better way to make coffee.\\\\n\\\\n\",\"translation\":null},\"status\":\"COMPLETED\"}\\n'"

For his achievements in athletics, he has been inducted into the International\\n\\n14\\n00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,260\\nSports Hall of Fame. He also held a Guinness World Record for the most pull-ups completed\\n\\n15\\n00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,400\\nin 24 hours. I should mention that not only was David a decorated Navy SEAL, but he also\\n\\n16\\n00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,840\\ngraduated from Army Ranger School. David is also a highly successful writer, having authored\\n\\n17\\n00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,040\\ntwo books, the first entitled Can't Hurt Me and the second entitled Never Finished, both of which\\n\\n18\\n00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,640\\nare bestsellers. David's books cover many topics including his autobiographical description\\n\\n19\\n00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,280\\nof what can only be described as an incredibly challenging child and young adulthood. His home\\n\\n20\\n00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,880\\nwas abusive, his school environment was abusive, he essentially had no positive resources directed\\n\\n21\\n00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,880\\nhis way. And in his 20s he found himself to be obese, that is more than 300 pounds working a\\n\\n22\\n00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,080\\njob he despised for minimal pay. And it was at that point that David began an inner dialogue\\n\\n23\\n00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,280\\nthat forced him to explore the demons born out of his childhood, but also the position that he\\n\\n24\\n00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,360\\nfound himself in as a young man, and then began the journey to navigate that dialogue and transform\\n\\n25\\n00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,840\\nhimself into the Navy SEAL, the ultramarathon runner, the best-selling author, and the\\n\\n26\\n00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,840\\nextraordinarily positive and influential man that he is today. As some of you may know, David has\\n\\n27\\n00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,480\\nhas done various public lectures.\\n\\n28\\n00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,680\\nHe's a familiar face online\\n\\n29\\n00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,640\\nbecause there are so many clips of him on YouTube\\n\\n30\\n00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,420\\nand he has done podcasts before.\\n\\n31\\n00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,760\\nHowever, I'm certain that you'll find today's discussion\\n\\n32\\n00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,520\\nto be very different than previous podcasts\\n\\n33\\n00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,640\\nthat David has been featured on.\\n\\n34\\n00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,760\\nThe reason is that,\\n\\n35\\n00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,500\\nof course we get into his accomplishments.\\n\\n36\\n00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,260\\nWe talk about the mindset\\n\\n37\\n00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,400\\nthat allowed him to achieve those things.\\n\\n38\\n00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,840\\nBut today, David really lets us under the hood.\\n\\n39\\n00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,200\\nHe lets us into the form of inner dialogue\\n\\n40\\n00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,800\\nthat he has to embrace,\\n\\n41\\n00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,360\\nindeed that he has to grapple with on a daily basis,\\n\\n42\\n00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,480\\nsometimes multiple times throughout the day and night\\n\\n43\\n00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,580\\nin order to impose the sort of self-discipline\\n\\n44\\n00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,320\\nthat he is so well-known for.\\n\\n45\\n00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,560\\nWe also get into some of the scientific mechanisms\\n\\n46\\n00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,040\\nunderlying willpower,\\n\\n47\\n00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,420\\nand we talk about David's current endeavors\\n\\n48\\n00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,400\\nthat include, for instance,\\n\\n49\\n00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,720\\nhis own exploration of science and medicine\\n\\n50\\n00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,560\\nfor which he has become an intense scholar and practitioner.\\n\\n51\\n00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,840\\nI should mention that multiple times\\n\\n52\\n00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,660\\nthroughout today's discussion, you will hear curse words.\\n\\n53\\n00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,960\\nNow, David and I both acknowledge\\n\\n54\\n00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,180\\nthat
